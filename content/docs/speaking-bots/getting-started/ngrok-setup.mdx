## Local Setup

For running one or more bots locally, you'll need an ngrok authtoken. Follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a free account at [ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)
2. After signing up, get your authtoken from the [Your Authtoken page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
3. Add the token to your `.env` file or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_ngrok_auth_token_here
```

That's it folks :)

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Configuration modification">

We provide a ready-to-use configuration file in the repository at `config/ngrok/config.yml`. You can either use this file directly or create your own configuration.

The default location for the ngrok configuration file varies by operating system:

- Linux: `~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml`
- Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\ngrok\ngrok.yml`

To verify your configuration file location, you can run:

```bash
ngrok config check
```

If you want to create or edit your own configuration file, here's what it should contain:

```yaml
version: '3'
agent:
  authtoken: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN

tunnels:
  proxy1:
    proto: http
    addr: 8766
  proxy2:
    proto: http
    addr: 8768
```

For more detailed information about ngrok configuration options, see the [official ngrok configuration documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/agent/config/).

## Usage

This sets up two separate tunnels (proxy1 and proxy2) that will be used by your bots to establish WebSocket connections with the meeting platforms. To start both tunnels simultaneously, run:

```bash
ngrok start --all
```
