Speaking Bots requires several API keys and configuration values to function properly. Here's a quick setup guide:

1. Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

{" "}

<Callout type="warn">
  Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It contains sensitive API
  keys that should be kept private.
</Callout>

2. Add your credentials to `.env`: You'll need 4 required API keys for core functionality (MeetingBaas, OpenAI, Speech-to-Text, and Text-to-Speech). Additional keys can be added later for optional features.
