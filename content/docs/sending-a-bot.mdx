title: Sending a bot
description: Learn how to send AI bots to meetings through the Meeting Baas API, with options for immediate or scheduled joining and customizable settings
---

You can summon a bot:

1. Immediately to a meeting, provided your bot pool is sufficient.
2. Or reserve one to come in 4 minutes.

Here's an example POST request to [https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots](https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots), sending a bot to a meeting:

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

<Tabs items={['Bash', 'Python', 'JavaScript']}>
  <Tab value="Bash">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY" \
         -d '{
               "meeting_url": "YOUR-MEETING-URL",
               "bot_name": "AI Notetaker",
               "recording_mode": "speaker_view",
               "bot_image": "https://example.com/bot.jpg",
               "entry_message": "I am a good meeting bot :)",
               "reserved": false,
               "speech_to_text": {
                 "provider": "Default"
               },
               "automatic_leave": {
                 "waiting_room_timeout": 600
               }
             }'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python

    print(response.json())
    ```

  <Tab value="JavaScript">

Let's break this down:

- `meeting_url`: The meeting URL to join. Accepts Google Meet, Microsoft Teams or Zoom URLs. (Required)
- `bot_name`: The display name of the bot. (Required)
- `reserved`: (Required)
  - `false`: Sends a bot from our pool of _always ready_ meeting bots, immediately. Beware that **demand might temporarily be higher than the number of currently available bots**, which could imply a delay in the bot joining. When possible, prefer the true option which reserves an instance of an AI meeting bot.
  - `true`: Reserves in advance a meeting bot for an upcoming meeting, ensuring the presence of the bot at the start of the meeting, typically for planned calendar events. You need to **call this route exactly 4 minutes before the start of the meeting**.
- `bot_image`: The URL of the image the bot will display. Must be a valid URI format. Optional.
- `recording_mode`: Optional. One of:
  - `"speaker_view"`: (default) The recording will only show the person speaking at any time
  - `"gallery_view"`: The recording will show all the speakers
  - `"audio_only"`: The recording will be a mp3
- `entry_message`: Optional. The message the bot will write within 15 seconds after being accepted in the meeting.
- `speech_to_text`: Optional. If not provided, no transcription will be generated and processing time will be faster.
  - Must be an object with:
    - `provider`: One of:
      - `"Default"`: Standard transcription, no API key needed
      - `"Gladia"` or `"Runpod"`: Requires their respective API key to be provided
    - `api_key`: Required when using Gladia or Runpod providers. Must be a valid API key from the respective service.
- `automatic_leave`: Optional object containing:
  - `waiting_room_timeout`: Time in seconds the bot will wait in a meeting room before dropping. Default is 600 (10 minutes)
  - `noone_joined_timeout`: Time in seconds the bot will wait if no one joins the meeting

Additional optional parameters:

- `webhook_url`: URL for webhook notifications
- `deduplication_key`: String for deduplication. By default, Meeting Baas will reject you sending multiple bots to a same meeting within 5 minutes, to avoid spamming.
- `streaming`: Object containing optional WebSocket streaming endpoints (16kHz):
  - `output`: WebSocket endpoint to receive audio stream from the meeting
  - `input`: WebSocket endpoint to stream audio back into the meeting
- `extra`: Additional custom data
- `start_time`: UTC timestamp (uint64) for scheduled start time

This request will respond with the identifier of the bot you just created:

```http
HTTP/2 200
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bot_id": 42
}
```
