# Getting Meeting Data

Your webhook URL will receive two types of data:
1. Live meeting events during the meeting
2. Final meeting data after completion

These events will start flowing in after [sending a bot to a meeting](/docs/api/getting-started/sending-a-bot).

## 1. Live Meeting Events

```http
POST /your-endpoint
x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY

{
  "event": "bot.status_change",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "status": {
      "code": "joining_call",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Status Event Fields

- `event`: The key-value pair for bot status events. Always `bot.status_change`.
- `data.bot_id`: The identifier of the bot.
- `data.status.code`: The code of the event. One of:
  - `joining_call`: The bot has acknowledged the request to join the call.
  - `in_waiting_room`: The bot is in the "waiting room" of the meeting.
  - `in_call_not_recording`: The bot has joined the meeting, however it is not recording yet.
  - `in_call_recording`: The bot is in the meeting and recording the audio and video.
  - `recording_paused`: The recording has been temporarily paused.
  - `recording_resumed`: The recording has resumed after being paused.
  - `call_ended`: The bot has left the call.
  - `bot_rejected`: The bot was rejected from joining the meeting.
  - `bot_removed`: The bot was removed from the meeting.
  - `waiting_room_timeout`: The bot timed out while waiting to be admitted.
  - `invalid_meeting_url`: The provided meeting URL was invalid.
  - `meeting_error`: An unexpected error occurred during the meeting.
- `data.status.created_at`: An ISO string of the datetime of the event.

When receiving an `in_call_recording` event, additional data is provided:
- `data.status.start_time`: The timestamp when the recording started.

For `meeting_error` events, additional error details are provided:
- `data.status.error_message`: A description of the error that occurred.
- `data.status.error_type`: The type of error encountered.

## 2. Final Meeting Data

You'll receive either a `complete` or `failed` event.
