title: Resync All Calendars
description: >-
  Initiates a complete refresh of data for all connected calendars. This
  operation performs a deep sync with each calendar provider (Google, Microsoft)
  to ensure all events are up-to-date. Each calendar is processed individually,
  with success or failure tracked separately. Returns a comprehensive result
  object containing successfully synced calendar UUIDs and detailed error
  messages for any failures. This endpoint is useful for ensuring the system has
  the latest calendar data when inconsistencies are suspected.
