  maintaining the same UUID. This operation is performed as an atomic
  transaction to ensure data integrity. The system automatically unschedules
  existing bots to prevent duplicates, updates the calendar credentials, and
  triggers a full resync of all events. Useful when OAuth tokens need to be
  refreshed or when migrating a calendar between providers. Returns the updated
  calendar object with its new configuration.
