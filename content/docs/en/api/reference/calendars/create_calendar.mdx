title: Create Calendar
description: >-
  Integrates a new calendar with the system using OAuth credentials. This
  endpoint establishes a connection with the calendar provider (Google,
  Microsoft), sets up webhook notifications for real-time updates, and performs
  an initial sync of all calendar events. It requires OAuth credentials (client
  ID, client secret, and refresh token) and the platform type. Once created, the
  calendar is assigned a unique UUID that should be used for all subsequent
  operations. Returns the newly created calendar object with all integration
  details.
