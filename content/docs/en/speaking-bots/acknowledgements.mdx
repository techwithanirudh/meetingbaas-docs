[Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) and [MeetingBaas](https://meetingbaas.com) both do the heavy lifting of powering the speaking bot - but the project requires many other core services to function.

As you can see in the technologies used below, speaking bots can connect to external services for pinging weather data or timezone information.
