## Installation

### 0. Clone Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository and navigate to it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Meeting-Baas/speaking-meeting-bot.git
cd speaking-meeting-bot
```

### 1. Prerequisites

Install ngrok on your machine if you don't have it already. Follow our [Ngrok Setup Guide](/docs/speaking-bots/getting-started/ngrok-setup) for a quickstart.

### 2. Set Up Poetry Environment

```bash
# Install Poetry (Unix/macOS)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install Poetry (Windows)
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Activate virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### 3. Compile Protocol Buffers

```bash
poetry run python -m grpc_tools.protoc --proto_path=./protobufs --python_out=./protobufs frames.proto
```

Protocol Buffers are used here by Pipecat to define a structured message format for real-time communication between components of the Speaking Bots system. Specifically, the [`frames.proto`](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/635aa6eb5bdee382729613b58279befdc5bc8eaf/src/pipecat/frames/frames.proto#L9) file defines three main message types:

1. `TextFrame`: For handling text-based messages
2. `AudioRawFrame`: For managing raw audio data with properties like sample rate and channels
3. `TranscriptionFrame`: For handling speech-to-text transcription results

Protocol Buffers is the backbone of consistent data serialization across services.
Read more in the [official Protocol Buffer documentation](https://protobuf.dev/downloads/) and [this Python Protocol Buffers tutorial](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/08/30/an-intro-to-protocol-buffers-with-python/).

### 4. Configure Environment

Set up environment variables by following our [Environment Variables Guide](/docs/speaking-bots/getting-started/environment-variables). This will walk you through setting up the required API keys for core functionality and optional features.

### 5. Run your first bot

```bash
poetry run python scripts/batch.py -c 1 --meeting-url LINK
```

Follow our [Command Line Guide](/docs/speaking-bots/command-line) for more examples and options.
