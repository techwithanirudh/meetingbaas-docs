          Updates a calendar integration with new credentials or platform while
          maintaining the same UUID. This operation is performed as an atomic
          transaction to ensure data integrity. The system automatically
          unschedules existing bots to prevent duplicates, updates the calendar
          credentials, and triggers a full resync of all events. Useful when
          OAuth tokens need to be refreshed or when migrating a calendar between
          providers. Returns the updated calendar object with its new
          configuration.
