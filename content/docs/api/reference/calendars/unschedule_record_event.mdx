          Cancels a previously scheduled recording for a calendar event and
          releases associated bot resources. For recurring events, the
          'all_occurrences' parameter controls whether to unschedule from all
          instances of the recurring series or just the specific occurrence.
          This operation is idempotent and will not error if no bot was
          scheduled. Returns the updated event(s) with the bot parameters
          removed.
