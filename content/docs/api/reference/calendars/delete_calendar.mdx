          Permanently removes a calendar integration by its UUID, including all
          associated events and bot configurations. This operation cancels any
          active subscriptions with the calendar provider, stops all webhook
          notifications, and unschedules any pending recordings. All related
          resources are cleaned up in the database. This action cannot be
          undone, and subsequent requests to this calendar's UUID will return
          404 Not Found errors.
