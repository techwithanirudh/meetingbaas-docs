          Updates the configuration of a bot already scheduled to record an
          event. Allows modification of recording settings, webhook URLs, and
          other bot parameters without canceling and recreating the scheduled
          recording. For recurring events, the 'all_occurrences' parameter
          determines whether changes apply to all instances or just the specific
          occurrence. Returns the updated event(s) with the modified bot
          parameters.
