          Integrates a new calendar with the system using OAuth credentials.
          This endpoint establishes a connection with the calendar provider
          (Google, Microsoft), sets up webhook notifications for real-time
          updates, and performs an initial sync of all calendar events. It
          requires OAuth credentials (client ID, client secret, and refresh
          token) and the platform type. Once created, the calendar is assigned a
          unique UUID that should be used for all subsequent operations. Returns
          the newly created calendar object with all integration details.
