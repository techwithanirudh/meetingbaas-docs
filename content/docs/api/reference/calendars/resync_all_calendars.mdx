          Initiates a complete refresh of data for all connected calendars. This
          operation performs a deep sync with each calendar provider (Google,
          Microsoft) to ensure all events are up-to-date. Each calendar is
          processed individually, with success or failure tracked separately.
          Returns a comprehensive result object containing successfully synced
          calendar UUIDs and detailed error messages for any failures. This
          endpoint is useful for ensuring the system has the latest calendar
          data when inconsistencies are suspected.
