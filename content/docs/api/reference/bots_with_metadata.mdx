          ## Parameters


          * `limit` - Maximum results per page (default: 10, max: 50)

          * `cursor` - Base64-encoded pagination token from previous response

          * `meeting_url` - Filter by partial meeting URL match
          (case-insensitive)

          * `bot_name` - Filter by partial bot name match (case-insensitive)

          * `speaker_name` - Filter by speaker name (preview feature)

          * `created_after` - Timestamp filter in format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss
          (e.g., "2023-05-01T00:00:00")

          * `created_before` - Timestamp filter in format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss

          ## Advanced Filtering & Sorting


          * `filter_by_extra` - Filter by exact values in the extra JSON
          payload:
            * Format: `field:value` or `field1:value1,field2:value2`
            * Example: `customer_id:12345` or `status:active,project:sales`
            * Supports string, number, and boolean values
            * All conditions must match (AND logic)
            * Case-sensitive exact matching
            * Bots without the specified field are excluded

          * `sort_by_extra` - Sort by fields in the extra JSON payload:
            * Format: `field` or `field:desc`
            * Example: `customer_id` (ascending) or `priority:desc`
            * Applied after filtering
            * Bots with the field come before bots without it
            * Supports string and numeric comparison

          ## Response


          Returns bot metadata including meeting details, duration, creation
          time, and speaker information. Uses cursor-based pagination for
          efficient navigation through large result sets.


          The `next_cursor` field will be null when you've reached the end of
          results.
