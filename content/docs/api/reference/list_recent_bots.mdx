title: List Recent Bots
description: >-
  Retrieves a paginated list of the user's bots with metadata, sorted by
  creation date (newest first) by default. Includes meeting details, duration,
  and custom data. Supports filtering by meeting URL, bot name, and date range.
  The `sort_by_extra` parameter can be used to sort by fields in the extra JSON
  payload (e.g., `customer_id` or `customer_id:desc`). The `filter_by_extra`
  parameter enables filtering by values in the extra JSON payload (e.g.,
  `customer_id:12345` or `customer_id:12345,status:active`). This endpoint
  provides a quick overview of bot activity without returning full transcript
  data.
