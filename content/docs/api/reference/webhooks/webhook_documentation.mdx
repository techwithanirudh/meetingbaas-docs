          Meeting BaaS sends webhook events to your configured webhook URL when
          specific events occur.


          ## Webhook Event Types


          ### 1. `complete`

          Sent when a bot successfully completes recording a meeting. Contains
          full transcription data and a link to the recording.

          ```json

          {
            \"event\": \"complete\",
            \"data\": {
              \"bot_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\",
              \"transcript\": [
                {
                  \"speaker\": \"John Doe\",
                  \"offset\": 1.5,
                  \"words\": [
                    {
                      \"start\": 1.5,
                      \"end\": 1.9,
                      \"word\": \"Hello\"
                    },
                    {
                      \"start\": 2.0,
                      \"end\": 2.4,
                      \"word\": \"everyone\"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ],
              \"speakers\": [
                \"Jane Smith\",
                \"John Doe\"
              ],
              \"mp4\": \"https://storage.example.com/recordings/video123.mp4?token=abc\",
              \"event\": \"complete\"
            }
          }

          ```


          The `complete` event includes:

          - **bot_id**: Unique identifier for the bot that completed recording

          - **speakers**: A set of speaker names identified in the meeting

          - **transcript**: Full transcript data with speaker identification and
          word timing

          - **mp4**: URL to the recording file (valid for 24 hours by default)

          - **event**: Event type identifier ("complete")


          ### 2. `failed`

          Sent when a bot fails to join or record a meeting. Contains error
          details.

          ```json

          {
            \"event\": \"failed\",
            \"data\": {
              \"bot_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\",
              \"error\": \"meeting_not_found\",
              \"message\": \"Could not join meeting: The meeting ID was not found or has expired\"
            }
          }

          ```

          - **error**: Error code identifying the type of failure

          - **message**: Detailed human-readable error message


          Common error types include:

          - `meeting_not_found`: The meeting ID or link was invalid or expired

          - `access_denied`: The bot was denied access to the meeting

          - `authentication_error`: Failed to authenticate with the meeting
          platform

          - `network_error`: Network connectivity issues during recording

          - `internal_error`: Internal server error


          ### 3. `calendar.sync_events`

          Sent when calendar events are synced. Contains information about which
          events were updated.

          ```json

          {
            \"event\": \"calendar.sync_events\",
            \"data\": {
              \"calendar_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\",
              \"last_updated_ts\": \"2023-05-01T12:00:00Z\",
              \"affected_event_uuids\": [
                \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001\",
                \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174002\"
              ]
            }
          }

          ```


          The `calendar.sync_events` event includes:

          - **calendar_id**: UUID of the calendar that was synced

          - **last_updated_ts**: ISO-8601 timestamp of when the sync occurred

          - **affected_event_uuids**: Array of UUIDs for calendar events that
          were added, updated, or deleted


          This event is triggered when:

          - Calendar data is synced with the external provider (Google,
          Microsoft)

          - Multiple events may be created, updated, or deleted in a single sync
          operation

          - Use this event to update your local cache of calendar events


          ### 4. `transcription_complete`

          Sent when transcription is completed separately from recording (e.g.,
          after retranscribing).

          ```json

          {
            \"event\": \"transcription_complete\",
            \"data\": {
              \"bot_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\"
            }
          }

          ```


          The `transcription_complete` event includes:

          - **bot_id**: Unique identifier for the bot with the completed
          transcription


          This event is sent when:

          - You request a retranscription via the `/bots/retranscribe` endpoint

          - An asynchronous transcription process completes after the recording
          has ended


          ## Setting Up Webhooks


          You can configure webhooks in two ways:

          1. **Account-level webhook URL**: Set a default webhook URL for all
          bots in your account using the `/accounts/webhook_url` endpoint

          2. **Bot-specific webhook URL**: Provide a `webhook_url` parameter
          when creating a bot with the `/bots` endpoint


          Your webhook endpoint must:

          - Accept POST requests with JSON payload

          - Return a 2xx status code to acknowledge receipt

          - Process requests within 10 seconds to avoid timeouts

          - Handle each event type appropriately based on the event type


          All webhook requests include:

          - `x-meeting-baas-api-key` header with your API key for verification

          - `content-type: application/json` header

          - JSON body containing the event details


          ## Webhook Reliability


          If your endpoint fails to respond or returns an error, the system will
          attempt to retry the webhook delivery. For critical events, we
          recommend implementing:


          - Idempotency handling to prevent duplicate processing of the same
          event

          - Proper logging of webhook receipts for audit purposes

          - Asynchronous processing to quickly acknowledge receipt before
          handling the event data


          For security, always validate the API key in the
          `x-meeting-baas-api-key` header matches your API key.
