          recordings.


          ## Bot Webhook Event Types


          ### 1. `complete`

          Sent when a bot successfully completes recording a meeting.


          **Payload Structure:**

          ```json

          {
            \"event\": \"complete\",
            \"data\": {
              \"bot_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\",
              \"transcript\": [

                  \"offset\": 1.5,
                  \"words\": [
                    {
                      \"start\": 1.5,
                      \"end\": 1.9,
                      \"word\": \"Hello\"
                    },
                    {
                      \"start\": 2.0,
                      \"end\": 2.4,
                      \"word\": \"everyone\"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ],
              \"speakers\": [
                \"John Doe\",
                \"Jane Smith\"
              ],
              \"mp4\": \"https://storage.example.com/recordings/video123.mp4?token=abc\",
              \"event\": \"complete\"
            }
          }

          ```


          **When it's triggered:**

          - After a bot successfully records and processes a meeting

          - After the recording is uploaded and made available

          - When all processing of the meeting recording is complete


          **What to do with it:**

          - Download the MP4 recording for storage in your system

          - Store the transcript data in your database

          - Update meeting status in your application

          - Notify users that the recording is available


          ### 2. `failed`

          Sent when a bot fails to join or record a meeting.


          **Payload Structure:**

          ```json

          {
            \"event\": \"failed\",
            \"data\": {
              \"bot_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\",
              \"error\": \"meeting_not_found\",
              \"message\": \"Could not join meeting: The meeting ID was not found or has expired\"
            }
          }

          ```


          **Common error types:**

          - `meeting_not_found`: The meeting ID or link was invalid or expired

          - `access_denied`: The bot was denied access to the meeting

          - `authentication_error`: Failed to authenticate with the meeting
          platform

          - `network_error`: Network connectivity issues during recording

          - `internal_error`: Internal server error


          **What to do with it:**

          - Log the failure for troubleshooting

          - Notify administrators or users about the failed recording

          - Attempt to reschedule if appropriate

          - Update meeting status in your system


          ### 3. `transcription_complete`

          Sent when transcription is completed separately from recording.


          **Payload Structure:**

          ```json

          {
            \"event\": \"transcription_complete\",
            \"data\": {
              \"bot_id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\"
            }
          }

          ```


          **When it's triggered:**

          - After requesting retranscription via the API

          - When an asynchronous transcription job completes

          - When a higher quality or different language transcription becomes
          available


          **What to do with it:**

          - Update the transcript data in your system

          - Notify users that improved transcription is available

          - Run any post-processing on the new transcript data


          ## Webhook Usage Tips


          - Each event includes the `bot_id` so you can correlate with your
          internal data

          - The complete event includes speaker identification and full
          transcript data

          - For downloading recordings, the mp4 URL is valid for 24 hours

          - Handle the webhook asynchronously and return 200 OK quickly to
          prevent timeouts


          For security, always validate the API key in the
          `x-meeting-baas-api-key` header matches your API key.
