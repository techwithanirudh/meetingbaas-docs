We're excited to announce several improvements to our streaming API and client applications for Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet. These updates enhance stability, performance, and functionality.

## New Features

### Streaming Format Specification

- You can now specify the streaming format for WebSocket streams, 16kHz or 24kHz.
- **audio_frequency**: The audio frequency for the WebSocket streams, defaults to 24kHz. Can be one of `16khz` or `24khz`.

### Microsoft Teams Client Update

- We've updated our Microsoft Teams client, reducing the number of bugs by 50%.
- Now supports live Teams links, including Microsoft Live Meeting URLs (e.g., `https://teams.live.com/meet/...`).

### Google Meet Client Update

- We've updated our Google Meet client, reducing the number of bugs by 10%.

### Zoom Client Update

- Released an entirely new Zoom client. Currently, video capture isn't supported, but we plan to release this feature within the next two weeks.
- Zoom is expected to be our most stable client.

## Implementation Timeline

These changes are now live in production.
