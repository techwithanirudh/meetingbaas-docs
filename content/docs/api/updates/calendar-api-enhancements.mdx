We've expanded our Calendar API with new filtering capabilities and improved calendar management. These enhancements provide more flexibility when working with calendar events and integrations.

## New Features

### Enhanced Event Filtering

The [`GET /calendar_events`](/docs/api/reference/calendars/list_events) endpoint now supports additional filtering parameters:

- `attendeeEmail` - Filter events by attendee email address
- `organizerEmail` - Filter events by organizer email address
- `startDateGte` - Filter events with start date greater than or equal to timestamp
- `startDateLte` - Filter events with start date less than or equal to timestamp
- `status` - Filter by meeting status (`upcoming`, `past`, or `all`)

### Improved Attendee Information

The `Attendee` object now includes a `name` field that provides the display name of the attendee when available from the calendar provider (Google, Microsoft).

## Migration Guide

1. Update your API clients to take advantage of the new filtering parameters
