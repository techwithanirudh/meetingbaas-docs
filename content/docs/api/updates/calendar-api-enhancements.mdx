We've expanded our Calendar API with new filtering capabilities and improved calendar management. These enhancements provide more flexibility when working with calendar events and integrations.

## New Features

### Enhanced Event Filtering

The [`GET /calendar_events`](/docs/api/reference/calendars/list_events) endpoint now supports additional filtering parameters:

- `attendeeEmail` - Filter events by attendee email address
- `organizerEmail` - Filter events by organizer email address
- `startDateGte` - Filter events with start date greater than or equal to timestamp
- `startDateLte` - Filter events with start date less than or equal to timestamp
- `status` - Filter by meeting status (`upcoming`, `past`, or `all`)

### Improved Attendee Information

The `Attendee` object now includes a `name` field that provides the display name of the attendee when available from the calendar provider (Google, Microsoft).

### Full Calendar Resync

New [`POST /calendars/resync_all`](/docs/api/reference/calendars/resync_all_calendars) endpoint to initiate a complete refresh of all connected calendars:

- Performs a deep sync with each calendar provider
- Tracks success or failure for each calendar individually
- Returns comprehensive results with successful syncs and detailed error messages

## Migration Guide

1. Update your API clients to take advantage of the new filtering parameters
2. Consider implementing the full calendar resync feature for scenarios where calendar data needs to be refreshed
