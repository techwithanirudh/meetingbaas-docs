We're excited to announce several improvements to our Calendar API endpoints. These changes include new features and some breaking changes.

## New Features

### Webhook Configuration Flexibility

- The `webhook_url` parameter is now optional on [`POST /calendar`](/docs/api/reference/calendars/create_calendar) endpoint if a webhook URL is already configured on the account

### Enhanced Event Information

- [`GET /calendar_events`](/docs/api/reference/calendars/list_events) now includes attendees information for each event
- [`GET /calendar_events/uuid`](/docs/api/reference/calendars/get_event) now returns the `calendar_id` of the event

### Recurring Events Bot Management

- New query parameter `all_occurrences` added to [`POST /calendar_events/uuid/bot`](/docs/api/reference/calendars/schedule_record_event)
- Allows scheduling a bot for all instances of a recurring event
- Same functionality added to [`DELETE /calendar_events/uuid/bot`](/docs/api/reference/calendars/unschedule_record_event)
- Enables bot removal from all occurrences of a recurring event

## Breaking Changes

<Callout type="warn">
### Bot Management Response Format

- [`POST /calendar_events/uuid/bot`](/docs/api/reference/calendars/schedule_record_event) now returns an array of events instead of a single event
- [`DELETE /calendar_events/uuid/bot`](/docs/api/reference/calendars/unschedule_record_event) now returns an array of events instead of a single event

</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
### Pagination Changes
- [`GET /calendar_events`](/docs/api/reference/list_events) endpoint no longer supports `offset/limit` pagination
- Implemented cursor-based pagination
- Response format changed to include a `next` field for fetching subsequent events
- Events are returned in batches of 100
- Example response structure:
  ````json
  {
    "events": [...],
    "next": "cursor_token_for_next_page"
  }
  ````
</Callout>
## Migration Guide

1. Update your pagination implementation to use the new cursor-based system
2. Modify your bot management logic to handle arrays of events instead of single events
3. Review any webhook configuration logic to take advantage of the new optional webhook_url parameter

## Implementation Timeline

These changes are now live in production.
