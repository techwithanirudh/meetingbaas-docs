Meeting BaaS allows you to automatically sync calendars from Outlook and Google Workspace to deploy bots to scheduled meetings. This guide will walk you through setting up calendar integration.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the calendar sync integration, ensure you have:

- An active Meeting BaaS account with API access
- A webhook endpoint configured to receive calendar event notifications
- Developer access to Google Cloud Console and/or Microsoft Entra ID

<Steps>

<Step>

### Authentication: Get your OAuth credentials

To start syncing calendars, you'll need two sets of credentials:

1. **Your App's Credentials (Service Level)**

- For Outlook: Your app's Microsoft Client ID and Client Secret
- For Google Workspace: Your app's Google Client ID and Client Secret

2. **End User's Credentials (User Level)**

- OAuth refresh token obtained when user grants calendar access to your app

<Callout type="info">
  Best Practice: Request calendar access as a separate step after initial user
  signup. Users are more likely to grant calendar access when it's clearly tied
  to a specific feature they want to use.
</Callout>

#### Required OAuth Scopes

For **Google Workspace**:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` - To read calendar and event data
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly` - To access event details

For **Microsoft Outlook**:

- `Calendars.Read` - To read calendar and event data
- `Calendars.ReadWrite` - Required if you need to modify calendar events

</Step>

<Step>

### Optional: List Raw Calendars

Before syncing calendars, you can use the <a href="/docs/api/reference/calendars/list_raw_calendars" target="_blank">List Raw Calendars</a> endpoint to view all your user's available calendars. This is particularly useful when a user has multiple calendars and you need to choose which ones to sync.

#### Request Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.meetingbaas.com/calendars/raw" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "google",
    "refresh_token": "USER_REFRESH_TOKEN",
    "client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
  }'
```

#### Response Example

```json
{
  "calendars": [
    {
      "id": "primary",
      "name": "Main Calendar",
      "description": "User's primary calendar",
      "is_primary": true
    },
    {
      "id": "team_calendar@group.calendar.google.com",
      "name": "Team Calendar",
      "description": "Shared team meetings",
      "is_primary": false
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Calendar IDs differ between providers. Google uses email-like IDs, while
  Microsoft uses GUID formats.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Create a Calendar Integration

Create a new calendar integration by calling the <a href="/docs/api/reference/calendars/create_calendar" target="_blank">Create Calendar</a> endpoint with the previously obtained credentials.

#### Request Example

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.meetingbaas.com/calendars" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "google",
    "refresh_token": "USER_REFRESH_TOKEN",
    "client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "raw_calendar_id": "team_calendar@group.calendar.google.com"  // Optional
  }'
```

If the `raw_calendar_id` parameter is not provided, Meeting BaaS will sync the user's primary calendar by default.

#### Response Example

```json
{
  "id": "cal_12345abcde",
  "provider": "google",
  "status": "syncing",
  "created_at": "2023-08-15T14:30:00Z",
  "raw_calendar_id": "team_calendar@group.calendar.google.com",
  "calendar_name": "Team Calendar"
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Store the returned calendar ID safely - you'll need it for future operations.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Managing Calendars

Once authenticated, you can manage your calendars:

- List Calendars: <a href="/docs/api/reference/calendars/list_calendars" target="_blank">List Calendars</a> - View all your synced calendars
- Get Calendar Details: <a href="/docs/api/reference/calendars/get_calendar" target="_blank">Get Calendar Details</a> - Check sync status

#### List Calendars Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.meetingbaas.com/calendars" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

#### Get Calendar Details Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.meetingbaas.com/calendars/cal_12345abcde" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Callout type="info">
  After initial setup, Meeting BaaS handles all calendar API interactions. You
  only need to respond to webhook events for calendar changes.
</Callout>

#### Sync Status Values

The calendar integration can have the following status values:

- `syncing` - Initial sync in progress
- `active` - Calendar is actively syncing
- `error` - Sync encountered an error (check the `error_message` field)
- `disconnected` - The calendar connection has been terminated

</Step>

</Steps>
