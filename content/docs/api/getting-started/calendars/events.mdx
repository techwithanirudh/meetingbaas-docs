After [setting up your calendar integration](/docs/api/getting-started/calendars/setup), you can work with calendar events and schedule recordings. This guide explains how to manage calendar events through the Meeting BaaS API.

## Event Management

<Steps>

<Step>
### Listing and Retrieving Events

Monitor and manage calendar events:

- List Events: <a href="/docs/api/reference/calendars/list_events" target="_blank">List Events</a> - See all upcoming meetings
- Get Event Details: <a href="/docs/api/reference/calendars/get_event" target="_blank">Get Event Details</a> - View meeting info and bot status

#### List Events Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.meetingbaas.com/calendars/cal_12345abcde/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "start_date_gte": "2023-09-01T00:00:00Z",
    "start_date_lte": "2023-09-08T23:59:59Z",
    "updated_at_gte": "2023-08-29T18:30:00Z"  // Optional, for webhook integration
  }'
```

<Callout type="info">
  The List Events endpoint supports various filtering options:

- `calendar_id` (required) - Which calendar's events to retrieve

- `start_date_gte` - Filter events starting on or after this timestamp

- `start_date_lte` - Filter events starting on or before this timestamp

- `updated_at_gte` - Filter events updated on or after this timestamp

- `status` - Filter by meeting status ("upcoming", "past", "all") - default is "upcoming"

- `attendee_email` - Filter events with a specific attendee

- `organizer_email` - Filter events with a specific organizer

- `cursor` - For pagination through large result sets

See the <a href="/docs/api/reference/calendars/list_events" target="_blank">List Events API Reference</a> for full details.

</Callout>

#### Get Event Details Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.meetingbaas.com/calendars/cal_12345abcde/events/evt_67890fghij" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Understanding Meeting Links

Meeting BaaS automatically detects meeting links within calendar events and can deploy bots based on your configuration.

<Callout type="info">
  Meeting links are detected from the event location, description, or custom
  properties depending on the calendar provider, habits or integrations of the
  user.
</Callout>

Each platform has its own link format that our system automatically recognizes.

</Step>

<Step>
### Recording Management

You can schedule or cancel recording events for specific calendar events:

- Schedule Recording: <a href="/docs/api/reference/calendars/schedule_record_event" target="_blank">Schedule Record Event</a> - Configure a bot to record a specific event
- Cancel Recording: <a href="/docs/api/reference/calendars/unschedule_record_event" target="_blank">Unschedule Record Event</a> - Cancel a scheduled recording

#### Schedule Recording Example

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.meetingbaas.com/calendars/cal_12345abcde/events/evt_67890fghij/record" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recording_mode": "speaker_view",
    "include_transcription": true,
    "bot_name": "Recording Bot",
    "bot_avatar_url": "https://example.com/avatar.png",
    "entry_message": "This meeting is being recorded for note-taking purposes."
  }'
```

<Callout type="warn">
  When scheduling a recording, the bot will automatically join the meeting at
  the scheduled time and begin recording based on your configuration.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Recording Options

The recording configuration supports the same options as manual bot deployment:

#### Visual Recording Options:

- `speaker_view` - Records the active speaker (default)
- `gallery_view` - Records all participants in a grid layout
- `audio_only` - Records only the audio from the meeting

#### Additional Features:

- `include_transcription: true|false` - Generate speech-to-text transcription
- `bot_name: "string"` - Custom name for the bot in the meeting
- `bot_avatar_url: "url"` - Custom profile picture for the bot
- `entry_message: "string"` - Message the bot will send upon joining

#### Canceling a Scheduled Recording

To cancel a scheduled recording:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.meetingbaas.com/calendars/cal_12345abcde/events/evt_67890fghij/record" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Callout type="info">
  Remember to handle webhook notifications to track the recording status and
  receive the final recording data. These updates can be used to determine
  whether to record new or updated meetings.
</Callout>
