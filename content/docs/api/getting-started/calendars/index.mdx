Meeting BaaS allows you to automatically sync calendars from Outlook and Google Workspace to deploy bots to scheduled meetings.

This helps you:

- **Automate recording and participation** in meetings without manual intervention

- **Implement your own business logic** with simple patching:
  - Apply business rules to new calendar events, and an initial patch for existing events registered by a given user
  - Update logic as your requirements change

## Key Benefits

- **Automated Bot Deployment**: Automatically send bots to meetings as they appear on calendars
- **Multi-Calendar Support**: Connect to both Google Workspace and Microsoft Outlook calendars
- **Real-Time Updates**: Receive webhook notifications when calendar events change
- **Selective Recording**: Apply business logic to determine which meetings to record

## Implementation Overview

1. First, [set up calendar integrations](/docs/api/getting-started/calendars/setup) using OAuth authentication
2. Then, [work with calendar events](/docs/api/getting-started/calendars/events) to schedule automated recordings
3. Finally, [implement webhooks](/docs/api/getting-started/calendars/webhooks) to receive real-time updates and handle maintenance

## Customizable Business Logic

One of the core strengths of our calendar synchronization API is how easily you can integrate your own business logic. The abstraction layer we provide gives you:

- **Flexible Decision Making**: Decide which meetings should be recorded based on any criteria you define (participants, meeting titles, domains, etc.)
- **Custom Automation Rules**: Automatically apply different recording configurations based on meeting types
- **Error Handling Control**: Implement your own retry logic and error handling strategies tailored to your application's needs
- **Integration with Your Systems**: Build your own connections to your workflows or other business systems

#### For example, you might implement rules to only record meetings:

- With external clients but not internal team meetings
- That contain specific keywords in the title or description
- Where the organizer has opted into recording
- During specific business hours or for particular teams
- With specific participant emails

The webhook-based architecture ensures your business logic operates in real-time as calendar changes occur, giving you complete control over your meeting automation.
