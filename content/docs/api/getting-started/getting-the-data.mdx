To get your meeting data, listen for POST requests to the webhook URL you set
up in your account.

You'll receive two types of data: live meeting events and post-meeting data.

<Steps>
<Step>
### 1. Live Meeting Events

The events we send you during the meeting are in the following format:

```http
POST /your-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: your-company.com
Content-Type: application/json
x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY

{
  "event": "bot.status_change",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "asfdgfdewsrtiuydsfgklafsd",
    "status": {
      "code": "joining_call",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Here's what each field means:

- `event`: The key-value pair for bot status events. Always `bot.status_change`.
- `data.bot_id`: The identifier of the bot.
- `data.status.code`: The code of the event. One of:
  - `joining_call`: The bot has acknowledged the request to join the call.
  - `in_waiting_room`: The bot is in the "waiting room" of the meeting.
  - `in_call_not_recording`: The bot has joined the meeting, however it is not recording yet.
  - `in_call_recording`: The bot is in the meeting and recording the audio and video.
  - `call_ended`: The bot has left the call.
- `data.status.created_at`: An ISO string of the datetime of the event.

</Step>

### 2. Success webhook

<Callout>
  To get the final meeting data, listen for POST requests to the webhook URL you
  set up in your account, or the webhook URL you used in your request.
</Callout>

You'll receive one of two events:

- `"event": "complete"`
- `"event": "failed"`

Here's an example for a `complete` event:

```http
POST /your-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: your-company.com
Content-Type: application/json
x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY

{
  "event": "complete",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "asfdgfdewsrtiuydsfgklafsd",
    "mp4": "https://bots-videos.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/path/to/video.mp4?X-Amz-Signature=...",
    "speakers": ["Alice", "Bob"],
    "transcript": [{
      "speaker": "Alice",
      "words": [{
        "start": 1.3348110430839002,
        "end": 1.4549110430839003,
        "word": "Hi"
      }, {
        "start": 1.4549110430839003,
        "end": 1.5750110430839004,
        "word": "Bob!"
      }]
    }, {
      "speaker": "Bob",
      "words": [{
        "start": 2.6583010430839,
        "end": 2.778401043083901,
        "word": "Hello"
      }, {
        "start": 2.778401043083901,
        "end": 2.9185110430839005,
        "word": "Alice!"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Let's break this down:

- `bot_id`: The identifier of the bot.
- `mp4`: A private AWS S3 URL of the mp4 recording of the meeting. Valid for one hour only.
- `speakers`: The list of speakers in this meeting. Currently requires transcription to be enabled.
- `transcript` (optional): The meeting transcript. Only given when `speech_to_text` is set when asking for a bot. An array containing:
  - `transcript.speaker`: The speaker name.
  - `transcript.words`: The list of words, each containing: - `transcript.words.start`: The start time of the word - `transcript.words.end`: The end time of the word - `transcript.words.word`: The word itself

</Step>

### 3. Failed webhook

<Callout type="warn" icon={<AlertTriangle className="h-5 w-5" />}>
  Here's an example of what you'll receive when a recording fails.
</Callout>

```http
POST /your-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: your-company.com
Content-Type: application/json
x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY

{
  "event": "failed",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "asfdgfdewsrtiuydsfgklafsd",
    "error": "CannotJoinMeeting"
  }
}
```

The failure types can be:

| Error                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CannotJoinMeeting     | The bot could not join the meeting URL provided. In most cases, this is because the meeting URL was only accessible for logged-in users invited to the meeting.                                                |
| TimeoutWaitingToStart | The bot has quit after waiting to be accepted. By default this is 10 minutes, configurable via `automatic_leave.waiting_room_timeout` or `automatic_leave.noone_joined_timeout` (both default to 600 seconds). |
| BotNotAccepted        | The bot has been refused in the meeting.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| InternalError         | An unexpected error occurred. Please contact us if the issue persists.                                                                                                                                         |
| InvalidMeetingUrl     | The meeting URL provided is not a valid (Zoom, Meet, Teams) URL. Please note Microsoft Live Meeting URLs (such as `https://teams.live.com/meet/...`) are not supported.                                        |
