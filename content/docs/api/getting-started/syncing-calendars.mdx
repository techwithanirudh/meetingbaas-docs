## Key Benefits

- **Automated Bot Deployment**: Automatically send bots to meetings as they appear on calendars
- **Multi-Calendar Support**: Connect to both Google Workspace and Microsoft Outlook calendars
- **Real-Time Updates**: Receive webhook notifications when calendar events change
- **Selective Recording**: Apply business logic to determine which meetings to record

## Implementation Overview

1. First, [set up calendar integrations](/docs/api/getting-started/calendars/setup) using OAuth authentication
2. Then, [work with calendar events](/docs/api/getting-started/calendars/events) to schedule automated recordings
3. Finally, [implement webhooks](/docs/api/getting-started/calendars/webhooks) to receive real-time updates and handle maintenance

This modular approach allows you to implement each component at your own pace and focuses the documentation on specific aspects of the integration.
