title: Removing a bot
description: Learn how to remove a bot from an ongoing meeting using the API
---

If you want to remove a bot from a meeting, send a DELETE request to [https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots](https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots) with the bot identifier:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots/YOUR_BOT_ID" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY"
```

Both API key and bot ID are mandatory.

The bot will leave the meeting and you will get the meeting data up to this point.

Expect us to reply simply with:

```http
HTTP/2 200
Content-Type: application/json

{ "ok": true }
```
